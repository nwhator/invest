# Supabase (optional)

This app is **RapidAPI-only**: arbitrage opportunities are fetched live server-side and are not persisted.

If you are only using the arbitrage scanner UI, you do not need Supabase.

If you still want a Supabase project for your own experiments, you can use [schema.sql](schema.sql) as a starting point.
It is intentionally minimal and can be left unapplied.
